# Reflection 2
## 2/2/2018
This week I have learned things about github, a website that you can post repository on.
One of the major thing I've learned is how to create repository on github,then copy it in Ubuntu and write stuff in there, and then post it back to github.
I also learned  mutiple new commands, mainly are the commands about github.
I'm getting better and better on these things I'm learning, and I will keep practice to get better and better.

I have learned many things about putty.
I learned how to create or delete a file and a folder. 
I learned how to check the things you have in the folder. 
I have also learned the difference between Python 2.x and Python 3.x. 
I know I am not good enough about these knowledge I have learned so far, but I will keep practice until I am very good at it.
